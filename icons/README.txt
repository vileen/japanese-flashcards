PWA Icon Placeholders Created!
==============================

SVG icons have been generated in the /icons/ directory.

For better iOS support, you should convert these to PNG:

Option 1: Use the generate-icons.html file
  - Open generate-icons.html in your browser
  - Click "Generate Icons"
  - Move downloaded PNG files to /icons/

Option 2: Use an online converter
  - Visit https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
  - Upload the SVG files from /icons/
  - Download and replace them

Option 3: Use ImageMagick (if installed)
  - Run: brew install imagemagick (on Mac)
  - Then run this script again

The app will work with SVG icons, but PNG is recommended for best compatibility.
